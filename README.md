# Pierre Aguié

I am a PhD student at Inria Paris and DI ENS, working with Laurent MAssoulié and Mathieu Even. Before that, I was an engineering student at École polytechnique, and graduated from the Master MVA at ENS Paris-Saclay.

I am mainly interested in optimization and statistical learning theory.
